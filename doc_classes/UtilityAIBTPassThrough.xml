	<description>
		The passthrough node calls the user-defined tick-method and then calls the tick-method of its child node, returning what ever the child node tick result is. If no child node has been defined, it returns what ever you choose for the tick-result.
		You can use this node to do preparations for a behaviour tree branch, for instance calculate some angles or distances that all the nodes within a branch will be using and putting them to user_data.
