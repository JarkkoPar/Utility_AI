		Base class for all UtilityAI behaviour tree nodes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Behaviour Trees are a commonly used structure that can be used to create artificial intelligence in games for the non-playable characters. A behaviour tree has a root node and under it a tree structure, where the branches of the tree define the behaviour for the AI.
		The utility enabled Behaviour Trees in Utility AI GDExtension extend the traditional Behaviour Tree with utility functions. The Behaviour Tree nodes can be used as a regular behaviour tree, but the extended utility features allow you to add utility-based branch selection and execution of the Node Query System queries within your trees.
		The Behaviour Tree in Utility AI GDExtension allows you to tick the tree by giving user_data as input. This user_data can be a dictionary that you want to use as the blackboard or the AI actor node itself. Or any other type of Variant. Or just null.

			Used with Utility-based Behaviour Tree nodes. This defines how the [UtilityAIConsideration] nodes (assigned as child nodes of the behaviour tree node) are evaluated to calculate the score for the node.
		</member>
		<member name="internal_status" type="int" setter="set_internal_status" getter="get_internal_status" default="0">
			The current internal status of the node, useful for debugging and seeing how the execution progresses. The following choices are possible: "Unticked:0,Ticked:1,Completed:2".
		</member>
		<member name="reset_rule" type="int" setter="set_reset_rule" getter="get_reset_rule" default="2">
			Defines how the Behaviour Tree node is reset. The following choices are possible: "WhenTicked:0,WhenCompleted:1,WhenTickedAfterBeingCompleted:2,Never:3".
		</member>
		<member name="score" type="float" setter="set_score" getter="get_score" default="0.0">
			The score this node received from the Utility-based evaluation.
		</member>
		<member name="tick_result" type="int" setter="set_tick_result" getter="get_tick_result" default="1">
			Result after the tick. The following choices are possible: "Running:0,Success:1,Failure:-1,Skip:-2".
