		Used when a behaviour is being executed by the AI agent.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node type should be added as child nodes of the [UtilityAIBehaviour] node. They are used when a behaviour is being executed by the AI agent.

		Action groups can be used create sequences of actions, or to pick one random action from several choices. This allows for more complex actions to be performed by a behaviour. You can nest as many action groups as you need, and they can contain any number and combination of actions or action groups.

		[b]Note:[/b] When the AI agent has chosen a behaviour, the action step function is called to find the first action to execute. The action that is being executed must be set as finished for the AI agent step function to be able to go to the next action. The action logic itself can be implemented anywhere else.
