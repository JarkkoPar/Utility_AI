		Aggregates input from several sensors (or sensor groups) for a higher-level input to the consideration nodes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node type should be added as child nodes of the [UtilityAIAgent] node. It is used to give input data to consideration nodes. A sensor is used by one or more consideration nodes. A sensor group is a node that can be used to aggregate input from several sensors (or sensor groups) for a higher-level input to the consideration nodes.

			A choice of how the sensors and sensor groups that are childs of the node are aggregated. Can be one of the following: Sum:0,Min:1,Max:2,Mean:3,Multiply:4,FirstNonZero:5.
