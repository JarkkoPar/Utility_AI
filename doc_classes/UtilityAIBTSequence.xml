		This node type is used to create sequences.
		The [UtilityAIBTSequence] node executes its child nodes from top-to-bottom order until either all of the succeed (returning [code]1[/code]) or one of them fails (returning [code]-1[/code]). If a child returns running (0) the sequence will return running to its parent.
