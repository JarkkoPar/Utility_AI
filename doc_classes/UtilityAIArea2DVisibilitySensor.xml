		Provides a visibility query based on [Area2D]s.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This sensor is used for visibility queries based on [Area2D]s. It returns the number of entities seen by the AI Agent and the sensor value is scaled to 0..1 by comparing the number of seen entities to a defined, expected, maximum number.
		The sensor will store a list of the found [Area2D]s that are within the defined visibility volume and a separate list with only those that are not occluded by other geometry.
