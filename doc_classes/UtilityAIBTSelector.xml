		This node type is used to create fallbacks.
		The [UtilityAIBTSelector] node executes its child nodes from top-to-bottom order until one of them succeeds (returning 1) or all of them fail (returning -1). If a child returns running (0) the selector will return running to its parent.
		The UtilityAIBTRandomSelector works similarly, it just shuffles the nodes into a random order before ticking them.
