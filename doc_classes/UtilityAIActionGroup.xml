		Creates sequences of actions, or picks one random action from several choices.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node type should be added as child nodes of the [UtilityAIBehaviour] node. They are used when a behaviour is being executed by the AI agent.

		Action groups can be used create sequences of actions, or to pick one random action from several choices. This allows for more complex actions to be performed by a behaviour. You can nest as many action groups as you need, and they can contain any number and combination of actions or action groups.

			A choice of how the actions that are child nodes are executed: Sequence:0,PickOneAtRandom:1,IfElse:2,CustomRule:3. The Sequence choice will execute the actions from top to bottom, the Pick One At Random does what it says it will, the IfElse rule uses the [member if_else_boolean_value] property to decide if the first or the second child node of the [UtilityAIActionGroup] will be chosen. Finally, the CustomRule choice allows you to write your own [code]eval[/code] method that is responsible for setting the [member current_action_index] property to choose what action should be executed.
